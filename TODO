IDE features
- Persist filesystem to local storage
- Load and save programs to filesystem
- Key mapping controls / numpad arrow support
- Speed controls
- Add a catalog with program entries
- Save states
- Break during input seems to leave editor coroutine around
~ Add a way to upload/download files from browser
~ Add a filesystem browser
+ Show symbols
+ Improve text editing, avoiding paste as HTML... bite the bullet and embed vscode?
+ Better debugging / single step UI
+ Full screen program

Language features
- Treat CALL ABSOLUTE with CD 33 + four args as mouse handler
- Multi-module program support: -CHAIN, -COMMON, +RUN
+ Verify weird scoping rules for deffn work
~ Painting patterns
~ Debugging statements TRON, TROFF, STOP
- Should be able to CALL SUBs without DECLARE
- Fully validate PRINT USING
- DOS emulation for SYSTEM, SHELL, IOCTL
- Do something with file locking LOCK/UNLOCK and ACCESS
- Better I/O emulation for WAIT, INP, OUTP (VGA registers? more?)
- Match circle rasterization for squishy aspect ratios
- Fix arithmetic precision for math functions, especially single vs double
  precision rounding issues
- Storage metacommands should only apply to DIM arrays
  "The $STATIC and $DYNAMIC metacommands affect all arrays except implicitly
  dimensioned arrays (arrays not declared in a DIM statement). Implicitly
  dimensioned arrays are always allocated as if $STATIC had been used."
- PEEK and POKE for memory mapped I/O stuff (keyboard lights?)
- Improve hacky VARSEG pointers so they can be recycled
- Deal with "advanced features"
  - ALIAS: doesn't parse
  - BYVAL: parses for DECLARE, but not for definitions...
  - CDECL: syntax error
  + COMMAND$: parses, unavailable
  - EVENT: syntax error
  - $INCLUDE: parses, unavailable
  - Int86
  - Int86X
  - LOCAL: syntax error
  - SADD: can call it... seems to work?
  - Interrupt
  - InterruptX
  - SETMEM: can call it...
  - SIGNAL: parses, unavailable
  - UEVENT: parses, unavailable
+ Support PEEK and POKE for VARSEG pointers
+ Modem support
